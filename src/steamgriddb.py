"""Cover-art fetching/caching from SteamGridDB, per game profile.

Talks to https://www.steamgriddb.com/api/v2 (confirmed against their real
OpenAPI spec at https://www.steamgriddb.com/static/openapi.yml - their docs
*page* blocks automated fetches, but the spec file itself doesn't) using a
user-supplied Bearer API key, which each user generates for free at
https://www.steamgriddb.com/profile/preferences.

Grid images (the classic box-art tile this fetches) have no "official" vs
"fan-made" distinction in the API - only Logos and Icons do (via a
`styles=official|custom` filter). So "prefer the official asset, otherwise
the first one available" simplifies for grids to just "take the top-scored
result", since the official-style filter in pick_best() below naturally
never matches anything and falls through - see pick_best().

Everything here is synchronous/blocking (plain urllib, no extra dependency)
by design; callers (gui.py) are responsible for running it off the Tk main
thread, e.g. via a daemon thread + root.after(0, ...) to marshal the result
back - the same pattern AsyncBridge uses for the engine's coroutines, just
without needing an event loop for something this simple.

    callers should treat None as "no artwork available right now" and just
    not show an image, not as something to surface as an error. If `log_fn`
    is given, it's called with a one-line reason on the network/API-error
    path specifically (not on "disabled"/"nothing found", which are normal,
    expected outcomes) - without this, a real cause like a bad API key or a
    malformed request just looked like "no cover art" with no way to tell
    why (see the get_grids() mimes-parameter bug this caught).

    `override_grid_id`, if given, pins the exact grid (image) to use among
    the game's available options instead of the default top-voted one
    pick_best() would otherwise choose - see gui.py's cover-image picker. If
    that id is no longer among the game's grids (e.g. deleted upstream since
    it was chosen), this falls back to pick_best() and logs why via
    `log_fn`, rather than failing outright over one stale reference.
