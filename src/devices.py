"""Device/channel registry (configs/devices.json) and per-channel runtime state.

Devices are addressed per *capability* (one buttplug "feature" x one output
type it supports), not per physical toy - a dual-motor device (e.g. Lovense
Edge) exposes two independent vibrate features, and a feature that supports
more than one output type (e.g. vibrate + oscillate) exposes each as its
own channel too, so nothing is ever forced to move in lockstep with
something else unless a keybind's "devices" list explicitly says so.
devices.json remembers a friendly nickname for each (device name, feature
index, output type) triple so nicknames survive reconnects/rescans;
keybinds then target one or more nicknames, or "all".
