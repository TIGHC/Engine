"""The Intiface Game Haptics Controller (TIGHC) - engine + cover-art library facade.

This module is a re-export surface, not where the implementation lives.
gui.py is built against `from src import tighc` / `from src.tighc import
NAME`; the actual code lives in focused modules, re-exported here so the
entry point has one place to import everything from:

  src/paths.py           - filesystem layout (configs/, profiles/, artwork_cache/, APP_ROOT for bundled resources)
  src/metadata.py        - project name/repo URL
  src/version.py         - version number + get_version()/get_version_tuple()
  src/ranges.py          - VibeRange/DurationRange/PulseSpec
  src/haptics.py         - configs/haptics.json load/apply + derived settings
  src/devices.py         - configs/devices.json registry + DeviceChannel
  src/profiles.py        - profiles/<id>/profile.json loading + Profile
  src/input.py           - keyboard/mouse normalization, focused-window lookup
  src/engine.py          - HapticsController, the engine itself
  src/steamgriddb.py     - SteamGridDB cover-art fetching/caching
  src/updates.py         - GitHub update check

This module isn't meant to be run directly - it's a library, imported by
gui.py.

Caveat for anyone adding new code: the settings re-exported below that
apply_haptics_config() can change at runtime (INTIFACE_WS,
MASTER_RANDOM_ENABLED, ENABLE_SMOOTHING, PANIC_KEY, ...) are snapshots
taken once, at import time - fine for every current caller (none of them
re-read these particular names from `tighc` after Settings are saved; the
engine itself reads them from src.haptics directly, which is what
actually makes live-reload work - see that module's docstring), but new
code that needs the *live* value should do the same rather than relying on
this facade.
