"""HapticsController: owns the buttplug connection, per-channel output
state, active profile, and input listeners - the actual haptics engine.

Listens globally for keyboard and mouse events (via pynput) and turns them
into vibration levels sent to connected toys (via the buttplug client). It
doesn't read game state directly - just raw input - so every "binding" is
really "this key/button is currently held" or "this key/button was just
pressed." The foreground window is watched continuously (see
_update_active_profile) so haptics automatically follow whatever game
currently has focus, going idle when nothing matches.

NOTE on `haptics`: every setting-derived read in this file goes
through the module itself (`haptics.NAME`), never a bare name copied
in via `from src.haptics import NAME` - see that module's docstring
for why: apply_haptics_config() reassigns its globals via `global`, and only
module-qualified access sees that update on a running controller's next
tick. This is what makes gui.py's Settings tab able to change these values
without an app restart.
