"""The Intiface Game Haptics Controller (TIGHC) - headless CLI entry point.

Run this to start the engine from the command line: `python cli.py`. Age
gate, then builds a controller from src/tighc.py's module-level config/
profiles (configs/haptics.json, configs/devices.json, profiles/) and
runs it until Ctrl+C. No GUI - hand-edit the JSON files and restart to
change anything.

Prefer an interactive configurator? Use `python gui.py` instead.
